In this notebook I try and scrape the wikipedia for movies by a particular production company.
The code is written such that just by changing the link to different production company 
movie list wikipedia page we willbe able to scrape those also.

Once the movie list is scrapped we save it into an excel file.
While scrapping this list we store the links to the wikipedia page of the movies and then scrape 
the information about the movies into a json file.
